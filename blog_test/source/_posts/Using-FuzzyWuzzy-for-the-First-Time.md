## FuzzyWuzzy

I firstly used FuzzyWuzzy for the first time after I knew its usage and feature on the official [FuzzyWuzzy website](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy). This is one of NLP (Natural Language Processing) package written in Python. 

I have tried this package as I am interested in some feature of this package.
